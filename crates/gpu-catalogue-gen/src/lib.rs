//! Generator for the GPU device catalogue.
//!
//! Emits `crates/zendriver-stealth/src/gpu/catalogue.rs` from two pinned
//! sources: driver-reported model names out of the fingerprint corpus, and PCI
//! device IDs out of `pci.ids`. Nothing here invents a value.
//!
//! The catalogue supplies *identity* only — a renderer string, a device ID, an
//! architecture token. Every capability number still comes from the measured
//! tier tables that `gpu-tier-gen` emits, which is what keeps this generator
//! from being able to fabricate a capability at all.
